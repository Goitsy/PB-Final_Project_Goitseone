# Final Project: Programming Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the final project of the Programming Basics module. This project is designed to challenge you to apply all the skills and knowledge you've acquired throughout the module. You will design and implement a project of your choice that demonstrates your proficiency in JavaScript.

## Project Options

Here are three set projects that you can choose from. You are required to complete at least one of these projects, but you are free to build as many as you like:

- [Shrugman](https://github.com/dci-fbw-wd-24-e02/PB-project-shrugman)
- [Pokemon Lite](https://github.com/dci-fbw-wd-24-e02/PB-project-pokemon-lite)
- [Bulls & Cows](https://github.com/dci-fbw-wd-24-e02/PB-project-bulls-and-cows)

**OPTIONAL**: You also have the option to create npm install node-emojiyour own project. This project **must** be built purely in JavaScript, and you need to communicate the idea to your teacher before you start.

## Deliverables

By the end of this project, you should have:

- A fully functional project (one of the three template projects).
- A README file documenting your project.
- A presentation of your working# Final Project: Programming Basics

## Node Packages

To enhance your projects, consider using the following Node.js packages. Each package is described briefly below, and you will need to read their documentation for more details.

- [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk): For styling terminal string output (colors, bold, etc.).
- [Colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors): Another package for using colors and styles in the Node.js console.
- [Readline-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync): For synchronous user input from the terminal.
- [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander): For building Node.js command-line interfaces.

## TypeScript Project

If you're interested in taking your skills to the next level, consider converting or creating a project in TypeScript. This will increase development time but can provide a great learning experience.

## Final Notes

You can be as creative as you want with these projects. Use this opportunity to solidify your JavaScript knowledge in preparation for the next module, Single Page Application.

Good luck üçÄ and please reach out if you need any support.
